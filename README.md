# B30 Angular 5 Technical Test

Clone this repo but please **do not push your work back to github** as other people will be doing this test. If you wish to share any code please zip it excluding the `node_modules` folder and email it back to me.

## Part 1 - Build tools - the harder part

Part 1 of this this test will require knowledge of:

* npm
* Webpack
* Webpack loaders and plugins
* Angular >2
* Sass

The objective of this part of the test is to build an Angular application compiled with Webpack 4 without using the Angular CLI.

**If you struggle with this it's not a problem. I'd like to see your working, how you approached the problem and how far you got. If you're completely stuck you can ask me for pointers or skip to step 2.**

I've pre-installed the packages you'll need to get the app up and running. You are not required to build the site for distribution; just the files served on the webpack dev server are fine. Make sure you employ best practices when structuring your application.

As this process can be a little fiddly if you've not done it before do not worry too much about encapsulated component css.

## Part 2 - Application development - the easier part?

Part 2 of this test will require knowledge of:

* Angular >2
* Sass
* HTML5
* Responsive design

`npm install; npm start;`

I've completed part 1 for you, now you'll need to make the application do something.
